With technology advancing each day, more ways to hack or spy are being invented. With that said, what is the probability that you are hacked or someone is spying into your android device (doesn't have to be phone alone)? No one can really tell but here are some codes that can help answer that question.

_These codes may or may not work depending on your android version_

## ➡️ To Find Lost or Stolen Phone

_**##1472365##**_\
This secret code turns on “Find My Device” mode on Android smartphones. Even without the Google app installed, it will make your device ring at maximum volume regardless of sound settings so you can locate it.\
Remotely activating this feature through your Google account online is also handy if your phone is misplaced but still has network connectivity.

## ➡️ To Factory Reset Phone

_**##7780##**_\
As a last resort, if you suspect malware, spyware, or someone has broken into your device, initiating a factory reset using this code wipes it completely clean, restoring it to ‘out-of-box’ conditions and removing all installed apps, accounts, files, and settings. Be sure to back up important data first.

## ➡️ To Check Unknown Connections (Android)

_**##4636## or ##197328640##**_\
If you’re concerned someone has installed malware or spyware on your Android phone, these codes open up a screen that lists all running processes and services. Carefully inspect for anything you don’t recognize that could indicate tracking software has been installed without your knowledge.

## ➡️ To Check if the Phone is Being Tacked or Tapped

_\***#21#**_\
For added security, dialing \*#21# on some Android phones will display whether your device microphone is enabled and if any applications currently hold the “RECORD\_AUDIO” permission, which could potentially mean your conversations are being recorded unlawfully. Be aware of any unfamiliar entries.

## ➡️ To Turn Off Phone Redirection

_**##002#**_\
If you notice suspicious call forwarding active on your line, immediately disable it by dialing ##002#. This resets all redirection options to the default settings. It’s wise to do this whenever you suspect someone may intercept or monitor your calls without permission.

## ➡️ To Show Unknown Connections (iPhone)

_**3001#12345#**_\
iPhone users have a similar code to check for tracking – 3001#12345# opens a “Field Test Mode” that displays diagnostic data about your phone’s cellular connection. Under the “Traces” tab, list any active connection attempts, which could expose if an unauthorized party is intercepting your location Pings or data traffic.

## Summary

In the medical field, it is said, _"prevention is better that cure"._ While this is true, it is also true when it comes to the security of our devices and more importantly, our data. Some practices that could help you prevent being hacked or spied on are:

* Avoid using third party applications on your android devices
* Do not click on any URL(link) and if you must, first verify its legitimacy
  * Some options to verify the legitimacy of a URL are [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/), [virusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url),
* Before downloading any application from the playstore, ALWAYS check the Reviews section and get to know what others have to say(Tip: Critical reviews will give you a better point of judgement)
* Avoid leaving USB debugging setting on. Always turn it off after development testing
* To make tracking your devices easier, always turn on your Find My IPhone option on your phone.
