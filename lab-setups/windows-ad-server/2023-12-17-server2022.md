Crucial! We have the option to administer the server in graphical user interface mode or through the command line interface. Each of the options has the Standard Evaluation OS and Datacenter Evaluation OS. In this example, we choose the Standard Evaluation with Desktop Experience.\

We choose the Custome installation type since it is a fresh install as compared to the Upgrade option.\
